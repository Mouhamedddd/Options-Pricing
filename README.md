# Option Pricing in C++
Description
This project involves implementing various option pricing models in C++, including Black-Scholes, Cox-Ross-Rubinstein, and Monte Carlo simulations. The project also includes the creation of a library with abstract classes for different payoff structures.

# Tools Used
C++, Financial Modeling, Option Pricing Models

# Key Features
Implementation of Black-Scholes, Cox-Ross-Rubinstein, and Monte Carlo models. Creation of a library with abstract classes for different payoff structures.

# How to Use
- Clone the repository.
- Compile the C++ code using a C++ compiler.
- Run the executable to price options using the implemented models.
- You can use the menu in the main file to price the type of option with the princing model that you want.
